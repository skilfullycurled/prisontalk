    "### RECORDS OF SCRAPED FORUMS DIFFER\n",
    "The scraped forums were placed in a list called forum_ids.csv.  This list differs from the forum ids from the file names (e.g., fid_3807.csv). First, I checked to find out which forums differered from each.  The forums that were in forum_ids.csv but *not* in the file list were checked in a browser and pointed to forums.  The forum ids that were in the files but *not* in forum_ids.csv did not go to a forum.  I loaded the first two files on the list (fid_3807.csv and fid_3808.csv) into a datafame and discovered that fid's were the same. I realized that most likely due to scraper error, these posts were given unique file ids but were from the same forum.  While it would appear that I was able to restart the scraper where it left off, they all need to be checked.  As you'll see below, this only applies to three forums: 38, 44, and 110.  The remaining two forums (957 and 1627) are discussed below.\n",

Although they are public in the sense that anyone can sign up to read them, the required login may also be a sign that these forums are more sensiteive than others, and therefore could fall under 'private'.  The domestic violence forum (957) is sensitive enough to require it's own treatment.  It is not soley from the title what the sensitive nature of the life after prison forum is, but again, this could be a paper all on it's own.\n",
